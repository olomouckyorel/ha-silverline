"""v3.5 end-to-end edge cases — parity with test_client_more.py (v3.3).

test_client_35.py covers the v3.5-specific surface (handshake, auto-probe,
fallback, get_status/set/push). These add the shared-machinery behaviors that
were previously proven only on the v3.3 path: request timeout, heartbeat over
the session key, reconnect WITH a fresh re-handshake, and malformed-frame
desync. Each rides on the negotiated session key, so they exercise the v3.5
codec end to end rather than re-testing protocol-agnostic plumbing in a vacuum.

The fake v3.5 device, its key timing, and the DP-query handler are reused from
test_client_35.py — there is one v3.5 lib fake server, not several.
